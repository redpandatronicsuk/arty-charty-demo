#ARTy Charty
## A React Native charting library using React Native ARTy

### TO-DO
- Dicovered that React Native already has a colour parser, here: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/9ee815f6b52e0c2417c04e5a05e1e31df26daed2/Libraries/StyleSheet/normalizeColor.js, maybe we can use that instead to reduce code size
- Zoom and navigator
- Spine lines
